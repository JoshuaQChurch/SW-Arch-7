# Software Architecture Group 7's Brokerage Service
### Developed by [Joshua Church](https://github.com/JoshuaQChurch) 
## Setup
This desktop application runs locally, so you will need to install [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (Windows), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) (Mac OSx), or [LAMP](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu) (Linux). 
Once you have installed your desired program, you will need to place the (3) folders -- **Model, View, Controller** -- 
into your root server location. 

  * **Example using WAMP:** This PC > SSD (C:) > wamp64 > www > [Place 3 folders here]

  * **Example using MAMP:** Macintosh HD > Applications > MAMP > htdocs > [Place 3 folders here]

## Test if your local server is running 
To make sure your local server is running, open a browser and type 'localhost' (without the quotes). 
If you get a message **"It Works!"**, then your local server is running.

## Test if SQL is working
Now you should test is SQL working. Do so by entering 'localhost/testmysql.php' (again, without the quotes). 
It should return a message saying **"Connection OK"**

## How to use the application
For an *optimal* experience, please use *Google Chrome* or *Safari*. 

1. Make sure you have placed the (3) folders in their correct destinations. 

2. Now, in order to run the application, type 'localhost/View'. 
  * The file 'index.html' should automatically call. 
  * If it does not, however, please type 'localhost/View/index.html'. 

3. From there, you will need to *Register* for an account. 
  * You must provide a valid email address. 

4. Once you create the account, you must login using your new credentials. 
5. Now you can use the application.
